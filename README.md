# AnthBot
Anthbot is a Discord bot developed in Python. It is a learning project, but also the recreation of a beloved bot that was shut down by its original creator.

# Progress

## To-Do List
- Modularize the codebase and organize it well so that it can be more easily scaled.
- Refine the code in ``duel.py`` so that it is more efficient and elegant.

## Accomplished
- Recreated the ``duel`` command that my friends and I used to use quite extensively many years ago. Very fun player-vs-player chat battle.
